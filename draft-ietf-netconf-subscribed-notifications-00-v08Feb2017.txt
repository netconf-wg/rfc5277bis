Abstract

   This document defines capabilities and operations for subscribing to
   content and providing asynchronous notification message delivery on
   that content.  Notification delivery can occur over a variety of
   protocols used commonly in conjunction with YANG, such as NETCONF and
   RESTCONF.  The capabilities and operations defined in this document
   when using in conjunction with draft-ietf-netconf-netconf-event-
   notifications are intended to obsolete RFC 5277.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines mechanisms that provide an asynchronous message
   notification delivery service in a protocol-agnostic manner.  This
   document defines capabilities and operations for providing
   asynchronous message notification delivery for notifications
   including those necessary to establish, monitor, and support
   subscriptions to notification delivery.

   Notification delivery can occur over a variety of protocols used
   commonly in conjunction with YANG, such as NETCONF [RFC6241] (defined
   in [I-D.ietf-netconf-netconf-event-notif]) and Restconf [RFC8040]
   (defined in [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf-notif]).  The capabilities and
   operations defined in this document are intended to obsolete RFC
   5277, along with their mapping onto NETCONF transport.

1.1.  Motivation

   The motivation for this work is to enable the sending of transport
   agnostic asynchronous notification messages driven by a YANG
   Subscription that are consistent with the data model (content) and
   security model.  Predating this work was [RFC5277] which defined a
   limited defines a notification mechanism for for NETCONF.  However,
   there are various [RFC5277] has limitations, many of which have been
   exposed in [RFC7923].

   The scope of the work aims at meeting the operational needs of
   network subscriptions:

   o  Ability to dynamically or statically subscribe to event
      notifications available on a publisher.

   o  Ability to negotiate acceptable dynamic subscription parameters.

   o  Ability to filter the subset of notifications to be pushed with
      stream-specific semantics.

   o  Ability for the notification payload to be interpreted
      independently of the transport protocol.  (In other words, the
      encoded notification fully describes itself.)

   o  Mechanism to communicate the notifications.

   o  Ability to replay locally logged notifications.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Configured subscription: A subscription installed via a configuration
   interface which persists across reboots.

   Dynamic subscription: A subscription agreed between subscriber and
   publisher created via RPC subscription state signaling messages.

   Event: An occurrence of something that may be of interest. (e.g., a
   configuration change, a fault, a change in status, crossing a
   threshold, or an external input to the system.)

   Event notification: A set of information intended for a Receiver
   indicating that one or more Event(s) have occurred.  Details of the
   Event(s) may be included within the Notification.

   Filter: Evaluation criteria, which may be applied against a targeted
   set of objects/events in a subscription.  Information traverses the
   filter only if specified filter criteria are met.

   NACM: NETCONF Access Control Model.

   OAM: Operations, Administration, Maintenance.

   Publisher: An entity responsible for streaming Event Notifications
   per the terms of a Subscriptions

   Receiver: A target to which a publisher pushes event notifications.
   For dynamic subscriptions, the receiver and subscriber will often be
   the same entity.

   RPC: Remote Procedure Call.

   Stream (also referred to as "event stream"): A continuous ordered set
   of events grouped under an explicit criteria.

   Subscriber: An entity able to request and negotiate a contract for
   the receipt of event notifications from a publisher.

   Subscription: A contract with a publisher, stipulating which
   information receiver(s) wishes to have pushed from the publisher
   without the need for further solicitation.

1.3.  Solution Overview

   This document describes mechanisms for subscribing and receiving
   event notifications from an event server publisher.  This document
   has similarities to the capabilities orginally defined in [RFC5277].
   This document extends the supported capabilties, and generalizes
   functionality to be protocol-agnostic.

   Some enhancements over [RFC5277] include the ability to have multiple
   subscriptions on a single transport session, to terminate a single
   subscriptions without terminating the transport session, and to
   modify existing subscriptions.

   The solution supports subscribing to event notifications using two
   mechanisms:

   1.  Dynamic subscriptions, where a subscriber initiates a
       subscription negotiation with a publisher via RPC.  If the
       publisher wants to serve this request, it will accept it, and
       then start pushing event notifications.  If the publisher does
       not wish to serve it as requested, then an error response is
       returned.  This response may include hints at subscription
       parameters which would have been accepted.

   2.  Configured subscriptions, which is an optional mechanism that
       enables managing subscriptions via a configuration interface so
       that a publisher can send event notifications to configured
       receiver(s).

   Some key characteristics of configured and dynamic subscriptions
   include:

   o  The lifetime of a dynamic subscription is limited by the lifetime
      of the subscriber session used to establish it.  Typically loss of
      the transport session tears down any dependent dynamic
      subscriptions.

   o  The lifetime of a configured subscription is driven by
      configuration being present on the running configuration.  This
      implies configured subscriptions persist across reboots, and
      persists even when transport is unavailable.

   o  Subscriptions can be modified or terminated at any point of their
      lifetime.  Configured subscriptions can be modified by any
      configuration client with write rights on the configuration of the
      subscription.

Internet-Draft             Event Notifications             February 2017


   Note that there is no mixing-and-matching of dynamic and configured
   subscriptions.  Specifically, a configured subscription cannot be
   modified or deleted using RPC.  Similarly, a subscription established
   via RPC cannot be modified through configuration operations.

   The publisher may decide to terminate a dynamic subscription at any
   time.  Similarly, it may decide to temporarily suspend the sending of
   event notifications for either configured or dynamic subscriptions.
   Such termination or suspension may be driven by the publisher running
   out of resources to serve the subscription, or by internal errors on
   the publisher.

2.  Solution

2.1.  Event Streams

   An event stream is a set of events available for subscription from a
   publisher.  It is out of the scope of this document to identify a)
   how streams are defined, b) how events are defined/generated, and c)
   how events are assigned to streams.

   That said, some event streams will be standardized whereas others may
   be vendor specific.  One standardized event stream is the "NETCONF"
   notification event stream.  The NETCONF event stream contains all
   NETCONF XML event notifications supported by the publisher, except
   for those belonging only to streams that explicitly indicate that
   they must be excluded from the NETCONF stream, such as notifications
   that serve OAM and signaling purposes.

   The following is a high-level description of the flow of a
   notification.  Note that it does not mandate and/or preclude an
   implementation.  As events are raised, they are assigned to streams.
   An event may be assigned to multiple streams.  The event is
   distributed to subscribers and receivers based on the current
   subscriptions and access control.  Access control is needed because
   if any receiver of that subscription does not have permission to
   receive an event, then it never makes it into a notification, and
   processing of the event is completed for that subscription.

2.2.  Event Stream Discovery

   A publisher maintains a list of available event streams as
   operational data.  This list contains both standardized and vendor-
   specific event streams.  A client can retrieve this list like any
   other YANG-defined data, for example using the <get> operation when
   using NETCONF.

Internet-Draft             Event Notifications             February 2017


2.3.  Filters

   a publisher implementation SHOULD support the ability to perform
   filtering of notification records per [RFC5277].  (TODO: since 5277
   is to be obsoleted, we should describe the filter here.)

2.4.  Subscription State Model at the Publisher

   Below is the state machine of a subscription for the publisher.  It
   is important to note that a subscription doesn't exist at the
   publisher until it is accepted and made active.  The mere request by
   a subscriber to establish a subscription is insufficient for that
   asserted subscription to be externally visible via this state
   machine.

   Of interest in this state machine are the following:

   o  Successful <establish-subscription> or <modify-subscription>
      requests put the subscription into an active state.

   o  Failed <modify-subscription> requests will leave the subscription
      in its previous state, with no visible change to any streaming
      updates.

   The data model is structured as follows:

   o  "Streams" contains a list of event streams that are supported by
      the publisher and that can be subscribed to.

   o  "Filters" contains a configurable list of filters that can be
      applied to a subscription.  This allows users to reference an
      existing filter definition as an alternative to defining a filter
      inline for each subscription.

   o  "Subscription-config" contains the configuration of configured
      subscriptions.  The parameters of each configured subscription are
      a superset of the parameters of a dynamic subscription and use the
      same groupings.  In addition, the configured subscriptions must
      also specify intended receivers and may specify the push source
      from which to send the stream of notification messages.

   o  "Subscriptions" contains a list of all subscriptions on a
      publisher, both configured and dynamic.  It can be used to
      retrieve information about the subscriptions which an publisher is
      serving.

   The data model also contains a number of notifications that allow a
   publisher to signal information about a subscription.  Finally, the
   data model contains a number of RPC definitions that are used to
   manage dynamic subscriptions.

4.  Dynamic Subscriptions

   Dynamic subscriptions are managed via RPC.

4.1.  Establishing a Subscription

   The <establish-subscription> operation allows a subscriber to request
   the creation of a subscription via RPC.

   The input parameters of the operation are:





Voit, et al.             Expires August 13, 2017               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft             Event Notifications             February 2017


   o  A filter which identifies what is being subscribed to, as well as
      what should be included (or not) in the pushed results.

   o  An optional stream which may identify or reduce the domain of
      events against which the subscription is applied.

   o  The desired encoding for the returned events.  By default, updates
      are encoded using XML.  Other encodings may be supported, such as
      JSON.

   o  An optional stop time for the subscription.

   o  An optional start time which indicates that this subscription is
      requesting a replay push of events previously generated.

   If the publisher cannot satisfy the <establish-subscription> request,
   it sends a negative <subscription-result> element.  If the subscriber
   has no authorization to establish the subscription, the
   <subscription-result> indicates an authorization error.  Optionally,
   the <subscription-result> may include one or more hints on
   alternative input parameters and value which would have resulted in
   an accepted subscription.

   Subscription requests must fail if a filter with invalid syntax is
   provided or if the name of a non-existent stream is provided.

4.1.1.  Replay Subscription

   The presence of a start time indicates that this is a replay
   subscription.  The start time must be earlier than the current time.
   If the start time points earlier than the maintained history of
   Publisher's event buffer, then the subscription must be rejected.  In
   this case the error response to the <establish-subscription> request
   should include a start time supportable by the Publisher.

4.2.  Modifying a Subscription

   The <modify-subscription> operation permits changing the terms of an
   existing dynamic subscription previously established on that
   transport session.  Subscriptions created by configuration operations
   cannot be modified via this RPC.  Dynamic subscriptions can be
   modified one or multiple times.  If the publisher accepts the
   requested modifications, it immediately starts sending events based
   on the new terms, completely ignoring the previous ones.  If the
   publisher rejects the request, the subscription remains as prior to
   the request.  That is, the request has no impact whatsoever.  The
   contents of a such a rejected modification may include one or more

   hints on alternative input parameters and value which would have
   resulted in a successfully modified subscription.

   Dynamic subscriptions established via RPC can only be modified (or
   deleted) via RPC using the same transport session used to establish
   that subscription.

4.3.  Deleting a Subscription

   The <delete-subscription> operation permits canceling an existing
   subscription previously established on that transport session.  If
   the publisher accepts the request, it immediately stops sending
   events for the subscription.  If the publisher rejects the request,
   all subscriptions remain as prior to the request.  That is, the
   request has no impact whatsoever.

   Subscriptions established via RPC can only be deleted via RPC using
   the same transport session used for subscription establishment.
   Configured subscriptions cannot be deleted using RPCs.  Instead,
   configured subscriptions are deleted as part of regular configuration
   operations.  Publishers MUST reject any RPC attempt to delete
   configured subscriptions.

4.4.  Killing a Subscription

   The <kill-subscription> operation permits an operator to end any
   dynamic subscription.  The publisher must accept the request for any
   dynamic subscription, and immediately stop sending events.

   Configured subscriptions cannot be kill using this RPC.  Instead,
   configured subscriptions are deleted as part of regular configuration
   operations.  Publishers MUST reject any RPC attempt to kill a
   configured subscription.

5.  Configured Subscriptions

   A configured subscription is a subscription installed via a
   configuration interface.

   Configured subscriptions persist across reboots, and persist even
   when transport is unavailable.

   Configured subscriptions can be modified by any configuration client
   with write permissions for the configuration of the subscription.
   Subscriptions can be modified or terminated via the configuration
   interface at any point of their lifetime.

   Supporting configured subscriptions is optional and advertised using
   the "configured-subscriptions" feature.

   In addition to subscription parameters that apply to dynamic
   subscriptions, the following additional parameters apply to
   configured subscriptions:

   o  One or more receiver IP addresses (and corresponding
      ports)intended as the destination for push updates for each
      subscription.  In addition, the transport protocol for each
      destination may be defined.

   o  Optional parameters to identify an egress interface or IP address
      / VRF where a subscription updates should be pushed from the
      publisher.  If not included, push updates will go off a default
      interface for the device.

5.1.  Establishing a Configured Subscription

   Configured subscriptions are established using configuration
   operations against the top-level subtree subscription-config.  There
   are two key differences between RPC and <edit-config> RPC operations
   for subscription establishment.  Firstly, <edit-config> operations
   install a subscription without question, while RPCs may support
   negotiation and rejection of requests.  Secondly, while RPCs mandate
   that the subscriber establishing the subscription is the only
   receiver of the notifications, <edit-config> operations permit
   specifying receivers independent of any tracked subscriber.
   Immediately after a subscription is successfully established, the
   publisher sends to any newly active receivers a control-plane
   notification stating the subscription has been established
   (subscription-started).

   Because there is no explicit association with an existing transport
   session, <edit-config> operations require additional parameters to
   indicate the receivers of the notifications and possibly the source
   of the notifications such as a specific egress interface.

   For example at subscription establishment, a client may send:

5.2.  Modifying a Configured Subscription

   Configured subscriptions can be modified using configuration
   operations against the top-level subtree subscription-config.

   Immediately after a subscription is successfully modified, the
   publisher sends to the existing receivers a control-plane
   notification stating the subscription has been modified (i.e.,
   subscription-modified).

   If the modification involved adding and/or removing receivers, those
   modified receivers are sent control-plane notifications, indicating
   they have been added (i.e, subscription-started to a specific
   receiver) or removed (i.e., subscription-terminated to a specific
   receiver.)

5.3.  Deleting a Configured Subscription

   Subscriptions can be deleted using configuration operations against
   the top-level subtree subscription-config.  For example, in RESTCONF:

   DELETE /subscription-config/subscription=1922 HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com

   HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
   Date: Sun, 24 Jul 2016 11:23:40 GMT
   Server: example-server

   notification stating the subscription has been terminated
   (subscription-terminated).

6.  Event (Data Plane) Notifications

   Once a subscription has been set up, the publisher streams
   (asynchronously) the event notifications per the terms of the
   subscription.  We refer to these as data plane notifications.  For
   dynamic subscriptions set up via RPC operations, event notifications
   are sent over the session used to establish the subscription.  For
   configured subscriptions, event notifications are sent over the
   specified connections.

   An event notification is sent to the receiver(s) when an event of
   interest (i.e., meeting the specified filtering criteria) has
   occurred.  An event notification is a complete and well-formed XML
   document.  Note that <notification> is not a Remote Procedure Call
   (RPC) method but rather the top-level element identifying the one-way
   message as a notification.  Note that event notifications never
   trigger responses.

   The event notification always includes an <eventTime> element.  It is
   the time the event was generated by the event source.  This parameter
   is of type dateTime and compliant to [RFC3339].  Implementations must
   support time zones.

   The event notifications must also include the subscription identifier
   if the establish-subscription was used in its establishment, or if it
   was configured via an operational interface.

   The event notification also contains notification-specific tagged
   content, if any.

   The following is an example of an event notification from [RFC7950]:

7.  Subscription State Notifications

   In addition to data plane notifications, a publisher may send
   subscription state notifications to indicate to receivers that an
   event related to the subscription management has occurred.

   Subscription state notifications are unlike other notifications in
   that they are not general-purpose notifications.  They cannot be
   filtered out, and they are delivered only to directly impacted
   receiver(s) of a subscription.  The definition of subscription state
   notifications is distinct from other notifications by making use of a
   YANG extension tagging them as subscription state notification.

   Subscription state notifications include indications that a replay of
   notifications has been completed, that a subscription is done sending
   notifications because an end time has been reached, and that a
   subscription has started, been modified, been terminated, or been
   suspended.  They are described in the following subsections.

7.1.  subscription-started

   This notification indicates that a configured subscription has
   started and data updates are beginning to be sent.  This notification
   includes the parameters of the subscription, except for the
   receiver(s) addressing information and push-source information.  Note
   that for RPC-based subscriptions, no such notifications are sent.

7.2.  subscription-modified

   This notification indicates that a configured subscription has been
   modified successfully.  This notification includes the parameters of
   the subscription, except for the receiver(s) addressing information
   and push-source information.  Note that for RPC-based subscriptions,
   no such notifications are sent.

7.3.  subscription-terminated

   This notification indicates that a subscription has been terminated
   by the publisher.  The notification includes the reason for the
   termination.  The publisher may decide to terminate a subscription
   when it is running out of resources for serving it, an internal error
   occurs, etc.  Publisher-driven terminations are notified to all
   receivers.  The management plane can also terminate configured
   subscriptions using configuration operations.

   Subscribers can terminate via RPC subscriptions established via a
   delete-subscription RPC.  In such cases, no subscription-terminated
   notifications are sent.  However if a kill-subscription RPC is sent,

   or some other event results in the end of a susbcription, then there
   must be a notification that the subscription has been ended.

7.4.  subscription-suspended

   This notification indicates that a publisher has suspended a
   subscription.  The notification includes the reason for the
   suspension.  A possible reason is the lack of resources to serve it.
   No further data plane notifications will be sent until the
   subscription resumes.  Suspensions are notified to the subscriber (in
   the case of dynamic subscriptions) and all receivers (in the case of
   configured subscriptions).

7.5.  subscription-resumed

   This notification indicates that a previously suspended dubscription
   has been resumed.  Data plane notifications generated in the future
   will be sent after the subscription terms.  Resumptions are notified
   to the subscriber (in the case of dynamic subscriptions) and all
   receivers (in the case of configured subscriptions).

7.6.  notification-complete

   This notification is sent to indicate that a subscription, which
   includes a stop time, has finished passing events.

7.7.  replay-complete

   This notification indicates that all of the notifications prior to
   the current time have been sent.  This includes new notifications
   generated since the start of the subscription.  This notification
   must not be sent for any other reason.

   If subscription contains no stop time, or has a stop time which has
   not been reached, then after the replay-complete notification has
   been sent notifications will be sent in sequence as they arise
   naturally within the system.

8.  Subscription monitoring

   Subscriptions can be subjected to management themselves.  The
   publisher must provide several a means by which the status of
   subscriptions can be monitored.

   Container "subscriptions" contains the state of all subscriptions
   that are currently active.  This includes subscriptions that were
   established (and have not yet been deleted) using RPCs, as well as
   subscriptions that have been configured as part of configuration.

Internet-Draft             Event Notifications             February 2017


   Each subscription is represented as a list element.  The associated
   information includes an identifier for the subscription, a
   subscription status, as well as the various subscription parameters
   that are in effect.  The subscription status indicates whether the
   subscription is currently active and healthy, or if it is degraded in
   some form.  Leaf "configured-subscription" indicates whether the
   subscription came into being via configuration or via RPC.

   Subscriptions that were established by RPC are removed from the list
   once they expire (reaching stop-time) or when they are terminated.
   Subscriptions that were established by configuration need to be
   deleted from the configuration by a configuration editing operation
   even if the stop time has been passed.

10.  Considerations

10.1.  Implementation Considerations

   For a deployment including both configured and dynamic subscriptions,
   split subscription identifiers into static and dynamic halves.  That
   way there should not be collisions if the configured subscriptions
   attempt to set a subscription-id which might have already been
   dynamically allocated.

   The <notification> elements are never sent before the transport
   layer, including capabilities exchange, has been established.

10.2.  Security Considerations

   A secure transport is highly recommended and the publisher must
   ensure that the user has sufficient authorization to perform the
   function they are requesting against the specific subset of content
   involved.  When a <get> is received that refers to the content
   defined in this memo, recievers should only be able to view the
   content for which they have sufficient privileges.  <establish-
   subscription> operations can be considered like deferred <get>, and
   the content that different users can access may vary.  This different
   access is reflected in the <notificationt> to which different users
   are able to subscribe.

   The contents of notifications, as well as the names of event streams,
   may contain sensitive information and care should be taken to ensure
   that they are viewed only by authorized users.  The publisher MUST



Voit, et al.             Expires August 13, 2017               [Page 41]

Internet-Draft             Event Notifications             February 2017


   NOT include any content in a notification that the user is not
   authorized to view.

   If a malicious or buggy subscriber sends a number of <establish-
   subscription> requests, then these subscriptions accumulate and may
   use up system resources.  In such a situation, subscriptions can be
   terminated by terminating the transport session.  The publisher can
   also suspend or terminate subscriptions with per-subscription
   granularity.

   A subscription could be configured on another receiver's behalf, with
   the goal of flooding that receiver with updates.  One or more
   publishers could be used to overwhelm a receiver, which doesn't even
   support subscriptions.  Subscribers that do not want pushed data need
   only terminate or refuse any transport sessions from the publisher.
   In addition, the NETCONF Authorization Control Model [RFC6536] SHOULD
   be used to control and restrict authorization of subscription
   configuration.  This control models permits specifying per-user
   permissions to receive specific event notification types.  The
   permissions are specified as a set of access control rules.

   Note that streams can define additional authorization requirements.
   For instance, in [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push], each of the elements
   in its data plane notifications must also go through access control.

   It is recommended that the NACM "very-secure" tag is placed on the
   <kill-subscription> RPC so that only administrators can access.

Appendix A.  Backwards Compatibility

   (To be removed if/when an agreement to remove 5277 compatibility is
   made)

   Capabilities are advertised in messages sent by each peer during
   session establishment [RFC6241].  Publishers supporting the features
   in this document must advertise both capabilities
   "urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:notification:1.0" and
   "urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:notification:1.1".

   An example of a hello message by a publisher during session
   establishment would be:

   <hello xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
       <capabilities>
           <capability>
               urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0
           </capability>
           <capability>
               urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:startup:1.0
           </capability>
           <capability>
               urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:notification:1.0
           </capability>
           <capability>
               urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:notification:1.1
           </capability>
       </capabilities>
       <session-id>4</session-id>
   </hello>

                          Figure 9: Hello message

   The mechanism defined in this document is identified by
   "urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:notification:1.1".  If a
   subscriber only supports [RFC5277] and not this specification, then
   they will recognize the capability
   "urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:notification:1.0" and ignore the
   capability defined in this document

Appendix B.  Issues that are currently being worked and resolved

   (To be removed by RFC editor prior to publication)

   Issue #9: validate that Subscription ID will only be relevant locally
   to a single receiver

   Issue #6: Data plane notifications and layered headers

   How to allow for seamless integration with non-standard encodings and
   transports (like GPB/GRPC).  Specify requirements encoding and
   transport must meet, provide examples.

Appendix C.  Changes between revisions

   (To be removed by RFC editor prior to publication)

   v01 - v02

   o  Kill subscription RPC added.

   o  Renamed from 5277bis to Subscribed Notifications.

   o  Extracted create-subscription and other elements of RFC5277.

   o  Error conditions added, and made specific in return codes.

   o  Simplified yang model structure for removal of 'basic' grouping.

   o  Adding a grouping for items which cannot be statically configured.

   o  Streams extracted if favor of more information in the filters
      section.

   o  Proposal for operational counters included per receiver.

   o  Subscription-id and filter-id renamed to identifier

   o  Section for replay added.  Replay-start and stop-time updated.
      Replay now cannot be configured.

   o  Control plane notification renamed to subscription state
      notification

   o  Souce address: Source-vrf changed to string, default address
      option added

Internet-Draft             Event Notifications             February 2017


   o  YANG Model changes.  New groupings for subscription info to allow
      restriction of what is changable via RPC.  Removed notifications
      for adding and removing receivers of configured subscriptions.

   o  Expanded/renamed defintions from event server to publisher, and
      client to subscriber as applicable.  Updated the definitions to
      include and expand on RFC 5277.

   o  Removal of redundant with other drafts

   o  Many other clean-ups of wording and terminology
